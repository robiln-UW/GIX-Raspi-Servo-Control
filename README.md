GIX-Raspi-Servo-Control

This repository contains code for controlling servos with a Raspberry Pi. It is intended to be used for the GIX Summer Robotics program. It contains code for both Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The Raspberry Pi sends serial commands over USB to the Arduino, which controls the servo via PWM.


[raspi](raspi) - python code to be run on the raspberry pi

[arduino](arduino) - .ino files to be run on the arduino
